The interview process has been good, the caliber of people – excellent and integration has been very smooth.\n\nA platform connecting customers with satellite providers, SkyFi makes satellite photography (and its arcane knowledge) accessible to stargazers everywhere.\n\nWith a vision that big, they’re shaping the future of satellite imagery:\n\nWe are trying to make satellite imagery as accessible and inexpensive as possible.\n\nDuring development, the SkyFi team found themselves overloaded with engineer-hiring chaos. They needed to scale fast, but they didn’t have enough devs, and time to find the exalted engineers they needed.\n\nAs they searched for help, they became trapped in a hiring labyrinth, endlessly searching through resumes and interviewing engineers that were merely meh. Without divine aid, their deadlines seemed impossible.\n\nThat’s when SkyFi found the light of Lemon.io.\n\nWe had decided that we needed to in-house the building of our front-end as opposed to outsourcing. And we needed to do that quickly.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Lemon.io presented a pool of divine developers, giving SkyFi time to run their own assessments and pick their perfect match.\n\nEmpowered by a dedicated dev, SkyFi was able to push on without getting mired in long hiring process. The Lemon.io devs have remarkably enhanced SkyFi’s performance, resulting in substantial cost savings and huge leaps in quality. Impressed by the Lemon.io developerhood, SkyFi then hired four more devotees from Lemon.io, including a Python, Sr React Native, two RN developers, and a DevOps engineer. Later on SkyFi team “buy out” all the Lemon.io devotees that worked with them, as they were absolutely brilliant fit for their team.\n\nWe have four people who already started working with us officially, and they’ve all been fantastic, and we have a couple more starting soon.

At the speed they were going, their growth outpaced perfection. They didn’t want to slow down, so they needed a team of reliable devs to clean code and head off any potential bugs.\n\nWe moved quickly in the development process. We shipped off rapidly and knew we would confront technical bugs on the way. That’s why we needed extra developers — to clean off all these bugs so the company could skyrocket.\n\nCalifornia, where tvScientific is based, is one of the most expensive USA areas to hire devs and engineers. That meant tvScientific’s windfall of cash would vanish if they hired locally.\n\nWith Silicon-Valley-caliber devs at a 20%-30% cost-savings over locals, Lemon.io offered a perfect solution for the startup.\n\ntvScientific started by hiring 3 Lemon.io engineers, but as they scaled, they realized they needed more hands on deck. So by April 2023, they’d onboarded another 4, making Lemon.io a go-to source for all of tvScientific’s tech hiring needs:\n\nThe developers helped us speed up.

He loved and hated the endless ocean of podcasts available at a click. On one hand, he had access to a vast pool of knowledge, with podcasts on every topic he could think of. On the other, he couldn’t find anything in there.\n\nThat’s when inspiration struck. He combined his day job with his new passion and created AI that would make a search engine for podcasts.\n\nThrough multiple prototypes, and with the help of a partner and incubator, Fathom was born. Using natural language processing AI, Fathom listens to and searches through podcasts to find exactly what users are looking for.\n\nAs an AI specialist, Kenneth found that coding the AI mastermind was the easy part. But when it came time to engineer the app that would introduce Fathom to the world, he didn’t have the experience or the extra hands to make it happen.\n\nSo, he started his search for devs that would give his all-knowing AI an appropriate temple.\n\nKenneth needed a coven of dedicated engineers with Nuxt.js, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Vue.js, and SwiftUI superpowers, along with solid UI experience. But when they tried to hire through Upwork, they got lost in a labyrinth of devious devs, burning time and money.\n\nThe Lemon.io team was able to find a developer for Fathom within 24 hours. Impressed with the offering, Kenneth approved the dev on the spot. After the initial hire, Fathom continued to leverage Lemon.io’s pre-vetted pool of devs, hiring 5 more devotees to scale their product to greatness.\n\nFor 18 months and counting, Fathom has relied on Lemon.io’s divine devs for miraculously fast product development.\n\nIf you were to hire an engineer from Lemon.io or an engineer from the States, would there be any difference in speed?

      "body_text": "Our back-end lead is impressed with the level of knowledge both Lemon.io engineers demonstrate.\n\nFor over a decade, Monique’s design and development agency managed online marketing for clients in the medical vertical. With every client, she noticed a gap in their marketing services.\n\nInstead of waiting for someone else to take care of it, she decided to solve the problem herself by creating Peptalkr.\n\nDeveloped specifically for an existing client, Peptalkr boosted patient retention and average visit time. Seeing the opportunity, Monique decided to scale. She onboarded 3 more clinics with more than 30,000 patients on a trial basis.\n\nSuch tools are often complicated, expensive, or altogether unavailable for self-service. Clients don’t have time and resources to invest in marketing — and stick to the available (albeit flawed) options.\n\nBased on the trial, Monique knew that in order to scale, she must simplify setup and automate client intake. But, it was just as important to maintain the human feel of the 1-1 work.\n\nThat meant a lot of work, too much for her team to handle alone. So Monique started searching for engineers to implement her plan. But not just any engineer would do. The devs needed to be proficient in .NET- and React, ready to work full-time, and be flexible enough to deal with the volatility of startup funding.\n\nMonique searched locally for half a year and ended up with nothing but a looming deadline. Time was disappearing quickly, so she gave up on local engineers and started looking overseas.\n\nEugene was brilliant. I onboarded him straight away and became part of our team just as fast.\n\nWhen Monique came across Lemon.io, the promise of vetted devotees captured her interest. As she wasn’t able to hire locally, this seemed like the perfect alternative.\n\nWithin 48 hrs of her first call, Lemon.io offered her a front-end React developer. A bit later, she requested a back-end .NET specialist and got one in less than two days.\n\nEach divine dev proved their worth immediately and helped move Monique’s vision of the Peptalkr app to market.\n\nThe backend part of the project is now more straightforward and demands less API resources. At the same time, user experience and front-end, in general, are also refined and more intuitive — that’s a big plus for a medical app like ours.\n\nJan worked for large European e-commerce websites and took part in apps development for Netflix, Tesla, Apple, Uber.

They had an almost finished product – and they’d even found their first customer.\n\nWith a customer already in the queue before their product was even finished, Velvet had cleared a massive hurdle in finding product market fit. But, a waiting customer also meant their launch deadline was set in stone, and they could not risk disappointing their very first b2b user.\n\nThe Velvet team was so close to a successful launch, but they were missing a single critical element: their front end.\n\nThey had great back-end specialists, which meant everything under the hood was ready to go. But, they didn’t have any front-end developers on the team. So, their front end still needed a lot of work, and they didn’t have anyone equipped to finish it.\n\nCTO Jaldeep wanted someone with front-end expertise and at least 5 years of experience working in React, Typescript and next JS. More than that, he wanted a developer who had led a team and knew how to collaborate but also had the ability to be effective on their own.\n\nMalky Volodarsky, Customer Success Team Lead\n\nIn short, Jaldeep needed a divine dev who could help Velvet reach the promised land of launch.\n\nBut with under two months to go, there was no time to embark on a long hiring process.\n\nIf Velvet didn’t get a skilled front-end developer on their team immediately, they would need to extend their release timeline. Worse, they would need to tell their first and only customer that they couldn’t deliver.\n\nThat’s when Velvet found the light of Lemon.io.\n\nWe were approximately a month and a half out from our launch date with our first customer, and we just needed an extra pair of hands to get us across the finish line on time.\n\nWhen Jaldeep contacted Lemon.io, he found them super responsive.\n\nIn just a week, he had a list of developers who were precisely filtered to his criteria. Within 48 hours, Jaldeep had chosen his favorites and scheduled interviews.\n\nKnowing he could trust the divine skill sets of Lemon.io devs, Jaldeep focused on finding a developer who not only thrived in the startup hustle but whose drive, determination, and goals meshed with Velvet’s team culture – a vibe Jaldeep had worked hard to create.\n\nAfter a few interviews, and some tweaks to Velvet’s requirements, Jaldeep interviewed Maksym and knew he had found the man for the job.\n\nWithin days, Maksym took over Velvet’s front-end development. Acting more as an employee than a contractor, he took ownership of every task and worked seamlessly with the team to finish the product.\n\nWith Maksym’s help, the Velvet team was able to deliver their product to their very first customer on time.\n\nToday, Velvet is hitting all the right notes with venues as they expand their product. Maksym’s work ethic has impressed Jaldeep so much, that he’s now a permanent part of the Velvet team.\n\nFrom day one, Maksym hasn’t really behaved as a contractor whose mindset is, I’m getting paid by the hour and I’m just doing what you’re telling me to do in those hours. He’s taken ownership over the work that he has been given and done it with the same enthusiasm and energy as a full-time employee.\n\nJan worked for large European e-commerce websites and took part in apps development for Netflix, Tesla, Apple, Uber.

      "body_text": "Lemon devs implemented core functionality for our products like advanced analytics features, complex distributed systems, optimizations, maintaining infrastructure, documentation, refactorings – basically every aspect of engineering and product activities.\n\nCurrents is a plug-and-play debugging platform that helps QA and software development teams take control of their end-to-end test automation.\n\nDesigned to integrate with popular testing frameworks like Cypress and Playwright, Currents upgrades the standard dashboard to integrate workflows, detect flaky tests and make testing faster. By collecting results and providing in-depth insights, Currents help teams optimize performance and troubleshoot issues with their automated tests.\n\nIn short, Currents makes developers’ and QAs’ lives easier.\n\nWe’re a bootstrapped company, and our main focus is trying to help our customers without breaking the bank.\n\nCurrents began as a cult of one. Andrew developed the software. He sold the software. He provided customer support.\n\nThough it allowed Andrew to kickstart the product, it was unscalable. So as demand kept growing, his product development plateaued because he just couldn’t be everything, everywhere, all at once.\n\nHe needed more hands. Looking back, Andrew says he should have started hiring a lot sooner.\n\nAs soon as you have enough money – if you got funding right away, or if you are bootstrapped and you have enough revenue – that’s the right point to start hiring because it’s a huge booster to the business.\n\nWith an eye to fostering growth, Andrew began his digital pilgrimage for devs. Online, he found plenty of options promising the world, but none of them delivered.\n\nEach time he worked with a talent agency, he would spend weeks waiting for devs. Worst of all, he was constantly paired with devilish devs who upset his timelines and his customers.\n\nThat’s when Andrew turned to his trusted startup community to ask for recommendations. And, that’s where Andrew discovered Lemon.io.\n\nLemon.io has been collaborating with Rob Walling and Tiny Seed accelerator for quite a long time, so the community vetted Lemon.io as a provider.\n\nAfter a few rounds of interviews, Andrew found exactly who he was looking for. Together with savvy senior developers from Lemon.io, Andrew built out new features and expanded Currents.\n\nWith functionality and infrastructure growing, Currents needed someone who could handle client support, including answering in-depth tech questions from the devs using their platform.\n\nSo, Andrew returned to Lemon.io to find a dev who could not only troubleshoot and answer clients’ questions, but also jump in wherever they were needed.\n\nThe guy we are working with now, Miguel, he’s our first-line customer support and software developer. He’s writing documentation, fixing bugs, talking to customers, and providing support sessions.\n\nAfter a few rounds of interviews, Andrew found exactly who he was looking for.

People who need less ramp up and can jump in right away.\n\nWith coming back to Lemon.io a few more times, Lemon.io became a go-to partner for Currents to build on their flawless product vision.\n\nJan worked for large European e-commerce websites and took part in apps development for Netflix, Tesla, Apple, Uber.

      "body_text": "The main thing was I wanted someone that I could trust because I have no developing experience. With my Lemon developer, I very quickly realized he was someone that I could have a lot of confidence in.\n\nAn app designed to help local restaurateurs, Scrumbly provides a platform for community restaurants to advertise in a way that both meets their budget and reacts to the needs of the current market.\n\nWith inflation outpacing wages, it’s tougher than ever for mom-and-pop shops to compete with conglomerates like McDonalds and Applebees. While the big chains continue to dump money into advertising their money-saving deals, local restaurants who can’t afford it are getting lost in the noise.\n\nBecause of the market, people are buying food from chain restaurants more and local restaurants less. I want to have the opposite effect by empowering local restaurants to get in front of customers.\n\nBy giving local restaurants a clear channel and making advertising more cost-effective, Scrumbly CEO Jackson Feldmon is leveling the playing field.\n\nAnd, by charging per click, Scrumbly ensures local restaurateurs are only paying for effective ads.\n\nIn short, Scrumbly makes life a little more local and a lot more delicious.\n\nIn my opinion, you find the best food at local restaurants. These passionate chefs create great food and a welcoming environment for the community to come together as a group.\n\nAs an entrepreneur with a Bachelor’s in Business Administration, Jackson never needed to learn how to code. He was more interested in building businesses than building apps.\n\nThat’s why he was able to see why local restaurants were struggling against their big-chain rivals. And, once he pinpointed the problem, he knew the solution: an app designed to support local restaurants.\n\nBut without a background in coding and development, Jackson could only dream up the plans – not bring them into reality. So when Jackson heard about Lemon.io on his favorite podcast, he seized the opportunity.\n\nOn my first call with Lemon, I was able to talk through what it would look like. During the conversation, I quickly realized, ‘hey, I’m not setting a developer up for success right now. I need to get some designs first.’\n\nSo, Jackson found a designer and ironed out the UX design.\n\nWith a design roadmap in hand, he knew his next step was to hire a dev to make his app a reality. Alongside Lemon.io, he considered Upwork. But while the lower hourly rate was tempting, he was worried about the quality of devs available on that platform.\n\nKnowing he wasn’t able to effectively vet a hire himself, Jackson returned to Lemon.io to find the right dev.\n\nI wanted someone who knew what they were doing and someone that I could trust. – someone that I could pretty much say, hey, I don’t know how to do any of this. I’m not going to be able to gauge your work. I will just be able to look at the final product and say if it’s good or not.\n\nLemon.io delivered Jackson a list of devs who could start working immediately.\n\nHis first match seemed solid, so Jackson hired him and set him to work. But, after a few weeks, the startup chemistry between the developer and Jackson waned. So, they parted ways. Learning from that experience, Jackson headed back to Lemon.io with more refined expectations.\n\nAnd that’s when Jackson found and hired a new divine developer.\n\nHe saw the vision right off the bat and he was super excited about it, really wanted to get working on it. He’s been super upfront with me and really good with communicating and giving me expectations on how long things are going to take.\n\nWith a passionate dev building the app, Scrumbly is well on its way to launch – and helping Jackson’s local restaurant community flourish.\n\nAnd a new developer? He’s super excited to be part of a project that is going to make a positive local change.\n\nIt’s become just as much of his project as my project, which is really cool.\n\nWith coming back to Lemon.io a few more times, Lemon.io became a go-to partner for Currents to build on their flawless product vision.\n\nJan worked for large European e-commerce websites and took part in apps development for Netflix, Tesla, Apple, Uber.

      "body_text": "As a non-technical founder, engineering can be a black box. I’ve learned how important it is to have someone in my corner who can really be a partner to me, not just say the right things. In that way, Lemon has really shown up. They weren’t just a matching tool. They really understood what I was looking for and found me someone I could trust to follow through and figure things out when I was in a major bind.\n\nMYNDY is a research-backed mental fitness platform that helps people train their mindset with daily exercise routines. At first, MYNDY’s founder, Lissy Alden, thought she’d design more of a coaching program, teaching individuals and groups mental fitness routines – and then leave them to implement those frameworks into their day-to-day.\n\nBut the more she began teaching and speaking with students, the more she saw an overwhelming preference for an accountability partner. An app that would remind people to exercise their brains and walk them through evidence-based training could help them feel good and become more productive wherever they were, fast.\n\nThough Lissy knew this was the path forward, it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park: she wasn’t a technical founder. And the first dev shop she worked with built an app that was barely functional and delivered months past the agreed-upon deadline. To get the app ready for release, she needed immediate help – and landed on Lemon.\n\nIn a scramble to get her app up and running, Lissy needed help she could trust, and of all the firms she met with, Lemon stood out.\n\nUnlike other engineering talent platforms, Lemon ran a really tight ship. Right away, they asked a series of questions around:\n\n“On the first call with Lemon, I was a little scattered because I was traveling,” Lissy explains.\n\n“But Iryna, my point of contact, was super professional and super focused. It made me feel like she would find the person I needed, no matter what. I felt cared for.”\n\nLissy was nervous about hiring just one person. And given the delays with the dev shop, she had to get it right.\n\nLemon put her at ease. “Their process was tight. I told them what I wanted: someone with experience in React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, and Twilio. I got a bunch of great profiles via the portal and set up interviews within days,” Lissy shares.\n\n“I met with Adriano, the dev I ended up onboarding, and immediately clicked with him. He seemed special.”\n\nOther companies were courting Adriano, but he showed interest in the MYNDY mission and what Lissy was trying to build. He even took the time to look at MYNDY’s code base and dove right in.\n\nFor Lissy, hiring a full-time staff member wasn’t a necessity. She just needed to get the MYNDY app built – and built properly.\n\n“I remember Lemon being expensive for my budget if I took someone off the platform and worked with them full time, but I was pleasantly surprised by their rates for short-term projects.”\n\nSince Adriano had the exact background and experience Lissy was looking for, she only needed to hire him on a month-to-month basis to work on the app.\n\nOnce Adriano started his contract, it was clear he was the perfect fit for the MYNDY project – a huge relief for Lissy. Besides having the technical know-how to fix the current issues with the app, Adriano is a great communicator and offered excellent advice for how to move forward.\n\n“He owned the project from the start,” Lissy says. “I said upfront I wanted someone who wasn’t afraid of conflict, and wouldn’t be afraid to push back. Adriano has delivered on all fronts.”\n\nThough the app isn’t finished yet, it’s nearly there. And compared to Lissy’s first attempt, this build has been smooth, fast, and collaborative. A few key reasons why the process is so much more seamless than the first go-round:\n\nBecause Adriano had already seen the codebase, it didn’t take long for Adriano to get into the rhythm of things.\n\n“After a few weeks of ramp-up, it was amazing. We love him,” Lissy emphasizes.\n\nAdriano completes work when he says he will. Whenever he hasn’t, he’s told Lissy well in advance, explained why, and told her when she can expect to see something.\n\n“He tells me if he isn’t going to get something done or we piled too much on his plate, which is a stark contrast to the company I was working with before that never spoke up about issues,” Lissy highlights. “I trust him to tell me things.”\n\nIf you’re working with someone day in and day out, it matters that they bring a positive attitude to their work. Adriano has this in spades. Lissy points out:\n\n“Adriano is talented, a fast learner, and a great member of the team. He operates like he cares about MYNDY just as much as anyone else. He is so much a part of the team that I invited him to my wedding. He’s just a delight.”\n\nLemon bills hourly, pays Adriano, and takes a cut for bringing Lissy the talent.\n\n“I reached out to Lemon a few times on payment stuff, and they are always responsive.”\n\nAfter nearly a year working together, Adriano doesn’t feel like a freelancer. He’s part of the team.\n\nThat kind of consistency is hard to find, as Lissy discovered firsthand. But it’s baked into Lemon’s approach: surface the most rigorously vetted developers to the people who need experienced talent, and stick with them through every step.\n\nBeyond introducing the perfect engineer right when she needed him, another Lemon team member, Olga, rolled up her sleeves to solve a problem outside of her scope simply because she cared.\n\nIt’s that kind of support that makes the biggest difference for a non-technical founder. Per Lissy:\n\n“They’ve shown up for me in a way no one else has. In a world where AI is supposed to be the answer to everything, Lemon made hiring feel human.”\n\nIf the right use case comes up again, she wouldn’t think twice about working with Lemon.\n\nNeed engineering support you can count on?

      "body_text": "We wanted to act FAST to build a new product that’s fit for the US market. Once we reached out to Lemon, we got things done at a speed I couldn’t have imagined. It didn’t take long for Lemon to find a great resource, then two more, and then another. Every single engineer they’ve brought us has been rock solid.\n\nDavid Haddad, Head of Product and Technology\n\nAdherium is a respiratory remote patient monitoring platform from Australia. Its signature product, Hailie® SmartInhaler, helps people with asthma and COPD breathe better – but it’s more than just an inhaler. The connected device pairs with an app for both patients and providers. It wants to:\n\nWith the effectiveness of this model, it’s not surprising that Adherium has been in the respiratory health business for nearly twenty years.\n\nBut with new reimbursement pathways and an eye towards value-based care, the company decided to shift its focus to the North American market. To keep pace, David Haddad, Adherium’s Head of Product and Technology, needed to build an expert engineering team and infrastructure – fast.\n\nWhen David contacted Lemon, Adherium needed coverage on multiple fronts: backend migrations, frontend work, DevOps, and QA. But he wanted to test the waters with an agency first in order to build value quickly for the company.\n\n“A client wanted some features specific to them, and I didn’t have an in-house resource, so I started reaching out to dev shops to see what they could do,” David explains.\n\nHe was disappointed. Besides coming in with higher quotes, they had multiple layers of management that would slow things down.\n\n“I find Brooks’s Law to be very true: the more people you have in a project, the greater the chance for communication breakdowns and errors. The other agencies just weren’t factoring in that communication tax.”\n\nLemon, he’d soon find out, was different.\n\nDavid had first come across Lemon in the My First Million Group and the Hampton network. Figuring he had nothing to lose, he decided to learn more about their model.\n\nLemon’s account team would be available if he needed billing support or assistance with future hires, but day-to-day, he’d work directly with an engineer – not funneling requests through a director, who would then pass them to a manager, who would relay them to the engineer actually doing the work.\n\nThat lean structure lowered Adherium’s total costs and cut out the potential for miscommunication.\n\n“It ended up being 50% cheaper,” he says.\n\nLemon lined up three strong candidates, and David ended up hiring one of them right away.\n\nHe didn’t have to waste his own time sifting through tons of resumes on Upwork, Toptal, or other sourcing platforms.\n\n“Lemon saved me from spending hours trying to source on my own or going through a lengthy, formal process with a recruiter. All the vetting happens upfront.”\n\n“I liked that I could use the resource part-time. That way, I could kind of right-size the commitment and land the plane with other things we were building,” David emphasizes.\n\nDavid started with one Lemon engineer, but quickly added another – and two more after that.\n\n“With all four of the engineers, it’s been like, ‘I’m up and running and firing on all cylinders. David highlights. “I’m sitting here stunned, going, ‘What is this? This is amazing.’”\n\nThat go-getter attitude carried into the specifics of their work:\n\nEugene, a platform engineer, identified areas for platform improvement within days.\n\n“I sent him an onboarding list of things to do,” David shares. “By day two, he’s done all that and is sending me back a list of all the things we can improve quickly at no additional cost.”\n\nWhen he needed access to specific systems, Eugene went straight to the right people (instead of adding more work for David). Soon, he implemented crucial healthcare compliance upgrades and strengthened observability and traceability across the platform.\n\nJohnny, a senior engineer from Brazil, restructured Adherium’s app, shifting it from a device-centric to a patient-centered approach.\n\n“Having been a two-time founder, Johnny really understands our strategy and where we’re coming from,” David highlights.\n\nHe made the app more consistent, suggested ways to expand its use cases, and solved pain points that had frustrated patients and care managers for years.\n\n“He’s been a fantastic thought partner, especially with ambiguous direction,” says David. “He has been super helpful for the business and how we present ourselves.”\n\nLemon engineers don’t just work from a brief. They join daily standups, they contribute to docs, and they communicate asynchronously with colleagues all over the world.\n\nWhen working on a server update, Eugene (in Ukraine) and Johnny (in Brazil) worked nearly 20 hours alongside internal Adherium resources (in Melbourne), handing the work off to each other until the issue was resolved.\n\n“They just slot right in. There’s regular communication across multiple time zones – they’re part of the way we work now,” David shares.\n\nAccording to David, Adherium’s other two Lemon engineers have been just as impactful.\n\n“Victor is a machine. He just gets things done. Rodrigo, our QA engineer, has only been here two weeks, but he’s been doing stuff that’s been in the works and needed for years. He’s even putting automation in place,” David notes.\n\nWhat’s routine for Lemon engineers has been transformative for Adherium.\n\nPer David, “It’s been great to have them as partners and help us scale up a bit.”\n\nFor David, the difference between Lemon and a traditional dev shop comes down to the model.\n\n“It’s not like a regular agency. You’re building a bond with people who feel embedded in your team,” he explains. “Lemon does a great job of screening for technical ability, but they also match for personality and fit.”\n\nThe relationship has already gone beyond transactional. David plans to meet one of his Lemon engineers in person while they’re on holiday in the US.\n\n“They’re fantastic engineers who don’t sit around twiddling their thumbs. They make stuff happen. They put the effort in, and that’s what’s made Lemon such a critical partner for us.”\n\nWant engineers who feel like a part of your team?

      "title": "Little Spoon hits 100% engineering hire rate with Lemon",
      "body_text": "Little Spoon is a D2C subscription brand that helps busy parents fuel their kids’ healthy development. The company has incredibly high standards for every food product they ship. In fact, Little Spoon is the first and only baby food in the US to set strict limits for 500+ toxins and contaminants – and no product is sold unless it passes rigorous testing.\n\nBesides offering the highest quality meals and snacks for kids, the company also produces best-in-class content, with “Is This Normal?”, a newsletter and blog where parents submit their questions around anything from fertility to picky eating to vacationing with kids, and doctors, dietitians, and other professionals weigh in with support.\n\nAs the leading end-to-end platform to support modern parents, the engineering team at Little Spoon has a big responsibility: building and maintaining the infrastructure that enables a seamless learning, ordering, checkout, billing, and delivery experience. And whenever they need an extra hand, they reach out to Lemon.\n\n“Whenever it becomes clear we need a new resource, I say, ‘I got a guy,’ and then immediately send the JD over to Lemon to see who they’ve got in mind. We get back potential candidates who are perfectly aligned with what we’re looking for, every time.”\n\nEric Garside, VP of Engineering at Little Spoon\n\nA hiring partner Little Spoon could count on\n\nWhen Eric joined Little Spoon, the eng team had already been supplementing their full-time roster with several freelancers – including folks from Lemon. Before he started doling out new tasks, he wanted to get a lay of the land, to understand what roles each of these contractors was playing, and whether he could rely on their work for the long haul.\n\n“Lemon was super accommodating about taking those devs off the Lemon payroll and having us hire them full time, so it was a win-win-win. We hired four devs rapid fire, Lemon got compensated, and the engineers joined a stellar team.”\n\nThe contractor-to-hire engineers continued to do great work, so Eric continued to keep Lemon top of mind, forming a closer relationship with the staff there.\n\nSoon after he hired those four devs, Eric started leaning on Lemon as his go-to for staff augmentation. Whenever he and his team started to feel overwhelmed, he would reach out to the Lemon team, knowing he’d get production-ready talent. Here are four reasons why working with Lemon, according to him, “just works”:\n\nOne thing Eric likes is how straightforward the Lemon process is. If he, say, wants a QA engineer (his most recent Lemon hire), he:\n\n“The resumes we get back are totally aligned with our mission and what we’re trying to achieve. Maybe one of those resources isn’t available anymore, so we chat with the other engineers and hire one of them. That’s basically the roadmap.”\n\nPartly, that’s because the communication between Little Spoon and Lemon is so clear. Eric knows what he wants, asks for it, and gets it.\n\n“I’ve literally had no issues, and that makes them my favorite vendor, full stop,” he says. “If I have a problem, Lemon solves it, and they don’t create any new problems in the process.”\n\nHiring software engineers, especially at a fast-moving startup like Little Spoon, can be an expensive risk. Hire the wrong person, and you may not end up knowing it until a few months in – and then you’ll have to start the recruitment, screening, and interview process all over again.\n\nBut with a partner like Lemon, Eric can hire someone part-time to explore a long-term working relationship. After a few months, he considers whether:\n\n“I have an unwavering trust in Lemon,” Eric highlights.\n\n“Now, every time I need a dev, I reach out to Lemon and ask them for some CVs. I believe we have a 100% hit rate. Every time I’ve asked for a role, they’ve given me resumes, we’ve reviewed them, we’ve hired somebody from them.”\n\nThe only exception to that 100% hit rate was a DevOps role that Eric originally reached out to Lemon for, but didn’t end up needing – he promoted someone internally.\n\n“I’ve never had this experience before as a leader. I wish I knew Lemon’s secret sauce!”\n\nEric is one of those leaders who wants to see things get done on a weekly cycle – he doesn’t care when. Tapping into non-US talent has helped him see things get done literally overnight (and gives devs the flexibility to complete their work at times when they’re most productive).\n\nEric points out: “With Lemon, we have access to engineers all over the globe. And because we’re using a modern language (JavaScript), using modern tech with modern people, it’s been pretty easy to find people who are in that sphere. As long as they can hand off and exchange the information that we need to keep the machines running, I don’t care when they work or where they work from.”\n\nLemon’s been able to find full-stack, QA, and other engineering professionals, not only with D2C-specific experience, but experience in more granular areas like payment processing and complex ordering structures.\n\n“We’ve used Lemon to find people who can do the whole gamut of development work, from updating our homegrown ordering system to managing Stripe and other integrations. These engineers have to be able to understand a variety of internal logic and business logic, and that seems like the sweet spot Lemon recruits for,” Eric says.\n\nEric hadn’t had great experiences with staff placement agencies in the past, so his expectations were low when he first heard Little Spoon was using Lemon.\n\nBut for the level of quality talent Eric is getting, price has never crossed his mind in the three years he’s been working closely with Lemon.\n\n“From using people for several-month contracts to converting them into full-time hires, I feel I’m only paying for overhead with Lemon. They’re a class above.\n\nLiterally, my first thought whenever a colleague at Little Spoon needs a new hire is to contact Lemon. I wish they had a pipeline for product talent, too. It’d be a dream to build an entire technical org with Lemon.”\n\nPart of the reason Eric trusts Lemon so much is that they’ve taken the time to grasp the nuances in Little Spoon’s culture and the unique needs of their engineering team. Saving specific filters, learning from candidates that were passed on, and listening closely to Eric’s requirements have helped them present the best possible candidates, again and again.\n\nThat kind of deep relationship makes hiring a fun exercise instead of a tedious and stressful one. As Eric puts it:\n\n“The Lemon story, from my perspective, is one of great success. It’s to the point where I’m like, ‘Everybody else kind of sucks and Lemon’s great.’ I’m a Lemon man now. I’d be dead in the water with them.”\n\nEric is confident that as Little Spoon keeps on delivering a top-notch service to their customers, they’ll need more and more top-notch talent, and Lemon will be his first call. We’re proud to find the right devs for companies like Little Spoon that are making a big impact in the lives of kids and adults alike.\n\nJan worked for large European e-commerce websites and took part in apps development for Netflix, Tesla, Apple, Uber.

      "title": "How Lemon helped RealEstateAPI scale – without burning out its CTO",
      "body_text": "RealEstateAPI is a data architecture that gives developers fast, easy access to property data. Historically, founders trying to build in proptech, lending, or home services only had two options when integrating property data:\n\nVince Harris, RealEstateAPI’s CEO and cofounder, set out to remove those barriers, designing a big data as a service platform built specifically for developers. Not surprisingly, RealEstateAPI caught on quickly, powering everything from map-based search tools to automated underwriting models, with nationwide coverage of over 157 million properties.\n\nWhile this was a welcome success, it came at a cost. Vince’s cofounder, the company’s CTO, was struggling to keep up with the rapid growth. After hearing about Lemon on Jason Calacanis’s podcast, This Week in Startups, Vince decided to reach out.\n\n“Lemon was impressive from the first interaction. I recommend Lemon 100%. In fact, I’ve already recommended them to others. We couldn’t have gotten RealEstateAPI to where it is today without Lemon – unless we completely burnt out our CTO.”\n\nBy the time Vince and his cofounder started looking for help, they were already underwater.\n\n“The challenge was a bandwidth issue,” Vince explains. “My CTO was doing everything, frankly, and he needed someone to step in and own the data engineering piece so he could focus on building out other areas of the product and keep RealEstateAPI’s momentum going.”\n\nThe team couldn’t afford to go through a long hiring process. Lemon had a reputation for moving fast – and from the very first interaction, they delivered.\n\n“Interpersonally, Lemon was very responsive,” Vince recalls. “They also had great tech – their online portal let us explore CVs, see specific skills, and review case studies of past work. I could even favorite candidates to keep track of who I liked most.”\n\nThe portal included a lightly gamified feature that showed which developers had recently received offers and were in high demand.\n\n“Being able to see that someone was actively being recruited elsewhere, that was huge,” Vince says. “It gave us confidence we were looking at top talent.”\n\nLemon’s deep roots in Eastern Europe were another feather in their cap.\n\n“We knew there was a lot of great talent in that part of the world,” Vince remarks. “The fact that Lemon is embedded there was a big green flag early on.”\n\nBut that’s not the only place Lemon’s developers are from. Clients can choose from talent in virtually every time zone.\n\n“We didn’t really care about time zones at the time we were looking for a resource, but it was nice to know Lemon could accommodate us if we did,” Vince notes.\n\nThe portal made browsing for candidates easy, but what saved the most time was Lemon’s upfront vetting.\n\n“We’ve used other hiring platforms before. Normally, you’re stuck weeding through 30 resumes trying to find the right people,” Vince points out. “But by the time Lemon presented us a pool of talent, they had done quite a bit of vetting,”\n\nInstead of dozens of resumes, Lemon gave Vince and his cofounder a shortlist of three, very qualified candidates. To confirm fit, they gave each engineer a practicum that mimicked the kind of work they’d be doing at RealEstateAPI. The Lemon engineer they hired outperformed the rest.\n\nFor a fast-growing startup, cost is always top of mind. But Lemon struck the right balance for the RealEstateAPI team.\n\n“For the caliber of talent we’re getting, I’d say Lemon is very reasonably priced,” Vince highlights.\n\nWith Lemon, RealEstateAPI got immediate impact and lasting value\n\nLemon’s hire didn’t just ease the CTO’s load, she quickly became an integral part of the team.\n\nOriginally, RealEstateAPI hoped to bring the engineer on through their HR system. When that didn’t work, Lemon stepped in.\n\n“It made more sense for Lemon to manage it, so they did. And it’s been very smooth since,” Vincent says.\n\nWithin days, the new engineer was fully integrated into the RealEstateAPI team, joining morning standups, making suggestions, and contributing to high-priority data projects.\n\n“The resource is phenomenal,” Vincent emphasizes. “I mean, she has really become a part of our team. She does not feel like a contractor who is temporary.”\n\nDay to day, she runs the data warehouse and manages all the company’s data pipelines – work that underpins the entire RealEstateAPI platform.\n\nPer Vince, “She’s been with us for over a year now, and we can’t see us separating from her any time soon.”\n\nLemon isn’t the kind of hiring platform that places an engineer and disappears.\n\n“Lemon checks in periodically in a way that’s not pushy, but helpful,” Vince shares.\n\n“Yes, it’s their business to sell more talent, but they’re clearly tracking our growth and reaching out when it makes sense. They ask the right questions about what roles we might need in the future.”\n\nTo him, Lemon feels like a partner who actually pays attention.\n\nAt one point, RealEstateAPI asked Lemon for a second resource. The engineer they hired was talented but more accustomed to large enterprise environments than a scrappy startup.\n\n“He was skilled, just not the right cultural fit,” Vincent explains. “But that wasn’t on Lemon. They delivered, it was just a mismatch for our stage.”\n\nThat experience didn’t shake their confidence – it built trust.\n\n“Lemon completely understood. Look, they have really good service, they operate with integrity, like we do, and that’s what we respect and enjoy about them. They’ve built a solid machine we can count on, and we’re continuing to go to them for more talent.”\n\nFor RealEstateAPI, Lemon’s engineer wasn’t just a quick fix. She’s become an indispensable team member who handles mission-critical work and gives the CTO room to breathe.\n\nWith her help, the company has continued to scale. So much so, they’ve already put in a request for another Lemon engineer who can support their next phase of expansion.\n\nJan worked for large European e-commerce websites and took part in apps development for Netflix, Tesla, Apple, Uber.
